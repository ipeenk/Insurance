One of the most difficult decisions you should make when choosing insurance is whether you should get whole life insurance or term life insurance. These two insurances have their own advantages and drawbacks. But if you want to compare the benefit, the first is actually better than the latter. However, it is not a secret that whole life policy can be very expensive. Despite of the price, this is actually the insurance that you should get if you want the best protection. Here are some reasons why this is the best insurance policy for you.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>It Gives Lifetime Protection</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
It is true that whole life policy is far more expensive than term life insurance. But you are not going to pay a lot of money for nothing because your life will be peaceful with this policy in your hand. This insurance plan will give you lifetime protection. As long as you pay the monthly premium, no matter what happens to you, there is a great insurance policy to back you up.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Same Premium Rate</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
At first glance, whole life insurance will look like a burden due to the high monthly premium rate. However, if you take what might happen in the future into consideration, it actually can be more cost effective than term policy. When you choose term policy, your protection will end when the term ends. If you want to continue again, you need to pay according to your age and current health condition. And since you are not getting younger, the premium definitely will be more expensive than the previous term.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
You don’t have to worry about increasing rate when you purchase whole life policy. Since the moment you purchase it until the day you die, the premium that you should pay will stay the same. Considering everything always getting more expensive as time goes, this policy is actually a very great investment for the future.</div>

<b>It Protects Your Family Too</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Just in case something happens to you in the future, you don’t have to worry about your family if you have whole life policy. It doesn’t directly give the same protection with what you get, but your family will be eligible to access the fund should something happen to you. Furthermore, you will also have the flexibility to borrow the cash value of your whole life insurance just in case you are in desperate needs of cash sometime in the future.</div>
